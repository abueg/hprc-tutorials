### Short Read Variant Calling With Giraffe & DeepVariant
This tutorial demonstrates variant calling using the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium's (HPRC) year 1 Minigraph/CACTUS pangenome with the Giraffe/DeepVariant pipeline for calling germline small variants. This workspace is intended to be a demonstration of utilizing a pangenome from the HPRC in AnVIL and Terra.

Instructions and a brief overview of the process can be found under `pangenome/giraffe-deepvariant`.
