# Phased Assemblies in Action

!!! info "Objectives"
```
- learn about different approaches to phasing
- generate a pseudohaplotype assembly, without using any additional phasing data
- generate a Hi-C-phased assembly
- identify QC metrics that can help assess phasing of assemblies
```

### Recap

- previously learned about assembly QC -> now we need to apply it by interpreting QC to see if an assembly is phased
