# Phased Assemblies in Action

!!! info "Objectives"
```
- learn about different approaches to phasing
- generate a pseudohaplotype assembly, without using any additional phasing data
- generate a Hi-C-phased assembly
- identify QC metrics that can assess phasing of assemblies
```

### Recap

- previously learned about assembly QC -> now we need to apply it by interpreting QC to see if an assembly is phased

!!! info "Key terms and concepts"
```
- CONTIG: contiguous (i.e., gapless) sequence in an assembly
- PHASING: phasing aims to partition the contigs for an individual according to their haplotype of origin. This is typically done using raed data from the parents to identify parentally inherited alleles. Recent approaches incorporate long-range Hi-C linkage information from the same individual to phase contigs. 
- PSEUDOHAPLOTYPE ASSEMBLY: assembly consisting of long, phased haplotype blocks separated by regions where the haplotype cannot be distinguished.
- SWITCH ERROR: 
- PRIMARY ASSEMBLY:
- ALTERNATE ASSEMBLY:
